Before i start i will like  to thank everyone who supported me from the beginning of this project  to the end  , i don't need to mention names. But there is a man called Sapa  he sat me down on a saturday morning and said you i will kill you. I buckle my belt properly for this great adventure .  

Before we start , I will like to say a very short story . Million  of years ago, people were together speaking the same language the same culture. But a king came in to power and decided to build a tall tower , he said he wants to ask God something , he got the best engineers in town . They're half way done before the angels reported to God about this king's mission . God commanded the angel to change their tongue so that there will be chaos among them . The next morning they started speaking in different languages
Man1:cassava benvenue!
man1:Gutten tag!
man4:Many people are dying ewo a gbo yinbo pressure ti wa .

The king shouted oh my God what happen to virgin!!!
